Introduction
============

MOFSynth is a Python package to ease and accelerate through **parallelization**, the
**calculation of** voxelized potential energy surfaces, or simply **energy voxels**,
with emphasis on reticular chemistry.

These energy voxels can then be used as a raw input for Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms or for manual feature extraction.OFSynth is a Python package for **MOF synthesizability evaluation**, with
emphasis on reticular chemistry.

In materials science, especially in the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),
a significant portion of time and effort is spent on the experimental process of synthesizing
and evaluating the viability of MOFs.

MOFSynth aims to provide a simple and efficient interface for evaluating
the synthesizability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in an experiment-ready format,
minimizing the time and labor traditionally required for these experimental preprocessing steps.
This allows researchers to focus more on innovative synthesis and experimental validation
rather than on preparatory tasks.

.. _advantages:

Why MOFSynth?
----------

This Python package streamlines the process of **evaluating the synthesizability** of MOFs,
significantly *reducing the time and effort* typically required for experimental preparation.
By automating the assessment of MOF viability, MOFSynth allows researchers to *focus more on
innovative synthesis and experimental validation*, rather than on labor-intensive preliminary tasks.
Its **user-friendly interface** and robust functionality make it an invaluable resource for accelerating
the discovery and development of new MOFs.

**All you need is your** ``.cif`` **!**

Objective
---------

A major chunk of time in an experimental study goes into assessing the synthesizability
of the materials and trying to find the best possible synthesizability routes,
rather than focusing on the productive steps.

MOFSynth aims to provide a **simple and fast interface to access the synthesizability
of MOFs**, in order to choose between possible candidates or even suggest the most promising ones.
